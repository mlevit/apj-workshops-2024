# Gen AI Exercises

This lab requires a bit more setup than some of the others.

We need to have: 
- FM API Token based pricing models available
- Vector Store Endpoint and index created

This can either be done manually or through the setup script.

## Setup

See the instructor notebook will will endeavour to automatically set the infrastructure up.
We will setup the vectorstore index itself in a separate notebook as this could be done as a walkthrough with students

**NOTE** FM API Token based pricing models are only available in certain cloud regions
**NOTE** Databricks Vector Search is only available in certain cloud regions
